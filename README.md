# EXF
EXF cryptocurrency is based on trust protocol. The protocol we call the trust protocol is actually based on the functioning of trust between people in normal life.

This process, known and naturally understood by all people, is basically based on previous experiences. A person we know and trust before and a person we have never met and have no knowledge about are not equal in terms of reliability. This is the natural flow of life, and that is what is right. The trust protocol in EXF has transformed the trust process between people in normal life into a software protocol.

This trust functioning, which is also at the center of our daily lives, consists of many parts. However, to summarize the basic principle of the trust protocol in a single sentence; "Hard to get, time consuming and easy to lose".

EXF, the cryptocurrency system, consists of a community with various roles within it. Within this community, security levels have been established according to the trust protocol.

Wallets are the most fundamental part of this community. In addition, intermediaries, mediators, local regulators, local auditors, representatives and decision makers make up this community.

Wallets are completely self determined which role they want to take in the community. But the constraint here is whether the wallet wishing to take the role has the necessary trust. A wallet determines its trust entirely on its own, based on its behavior in the community. Just like in normal life. According to the wallet trust status, it can take its place in the community. Trust, and hence reputation, is fundamental to this community.

No role in the Community has any effect on the ownership rights of wallets in the other role.
