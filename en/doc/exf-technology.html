                    <hr>
                    <p>EXF, unlike many cryptocurrencies, uses a hybrid network architecture. EXF uses P2P and Client-Server network architectures simultaneously. Each server works simultaneously as a Peer in the P2P network. Both desktop and mobile phone wallet application first try to run on Client-Server architecture. If it cannot get the required response from here, it works in the P2P network. Applications on the server operate on both Client-Server and P2P networks. </p>
                    <p>Once the EXF has completed the <a href="/en/doc/the-stock-market.html#startup-funding" title="startup funding" class="link">startup funding</a>, the system will be operational for the country where the wallet is located, when the local regulators in that country are operational. In order to create a wallet for the first time in any country, local regulators must be operational in that country. </p>
                    <h2 class="sub-header" id="introduction">Main Wallets</h2>
                    <p>The EXF cryptocurrency system is composed of four main wallets, structured on a single wallet.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="genesis-wallet-gnsw">Genesis Wallet (<abbr title="Genesis Wallet">GNSW</abbr>
                        )</h3>
                    <p>It is the origin wallet that makes up the entire EXF system. Wallets that can generate assets/values or put the assets and values they produce out of circulation; It will transfer to the block by the wallets that will transfer to the block by the Genesis wallet. Any wallet that is not transferred to the block by the wallets transferred to the block by Genesis cannot generate assets/values within the EXF system. Each of the wallets Genesis transfers to the block can only transfer to the block for the asset/value generation of a single wallet. In addition, the wallets that GNSW transferred to the block also transferred the four basic wallets of the EXF system to the block. These are System Wallet (EXFW), Gold Wallet (EAUW), Reserve Wallet (RSVW) and Investment Wallet (INSW) wallet.</p>
                    <p>The first wallet that the Genesis wallet transfers to the block; EXFW has transferred its wallet to the block. EXFW produced 2.500.000.000.000 EXF. In return for this 2.500.000.000.000 EXF, the second wallet transferred to the block by GNSW; EAUW has transferred its wallet to the block. The EAUW wallet produced 2,500,000,000,000 EAU. The third wallet that Genesis wallet transferred to the block transferred the Reserve wallet to the block. The fourth wallet that Genesis wallet transferred to the block transferred the Investment wallet (INSW) to the block.</p>
                    <p>The Genesis wallet is the origin wallet of the system that transfers the wallets that will generate value to the block. It is the beginning of the system. The Genesis (GNSW) wallet itself cannot generate value and cannot transfer any assets to the system. Genesis (GNSW) cannot generate value in wallets that the wallet transfers to the block and cannot transfer any assets/values to the system. Only and only; they transfer a single wallet that will generate assets to the block.</p>
                    <p>Except for EXFW generating EXF, which is transferred to the block by wallets transferred by Genesis wallet to the block, all wallets can transfer assets/values only with the digital signature of the wallets transferred by the Reserve wallet to the block. And they can only deprecate their own generated values.</p>
                    <p>In addition, all wallets except the EXFW wallet accompany the asset and value transactions they generate with the digital signature of the wallets they transfer to the block. What this means is that for an EAU transfer, the crypto key pair that will sign this transfer transaction is transferred to the block by the EAUW wallet. And afterwards; In the transfer transaction, he signs the status of the transaction. For each EAU transaction, a crypto key pair is generated by the EAUW wallet and transferred to the block. The private key of this key pair is then irretrievably deleted from the system. This key pair is transferred to its own wallet block by signing the EAU transaction.</p>
                    <p>In addition, except the Reserve wallet EXF, the transfers of all values generated for the EXF system are accompanied by the digital signature of the wallets that it transfers to the block. Apart from the EXF, all transactions of value and assets generated for the EXF system (for example, the EAU transfer) are accompanied by digitally signing the wallets transferred by the Reserve wallet to the block. To summarize briefly, when trading EAU between wallets, they are accompanied by the EAUW wallet and the RSVW wallet. In other words, both the EAUW wallet signs this transaction with a key pair to accompany this transaction, and the RSVW wallet also signs the transaction with the key pair it will generate for this transaction.</p>
                    <p>For wallets that have been transferred to the block by the Genesis wallet, transferred to the block by the wallets and will generate their own values; which condition, amount, for how long and in what form it can produce value is clearly stated in the transaction. Wallets that fail to meet these conditions will be deprecated by the wallet transferred to the block by the Genesis wallet.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="system-wallet-exfw">System Wallet (<abbr title="Exchangeable Fund Wallet">EXFW</abbr>)</h3>
                    <p>The first wallet transferred to the block by the Genesis wallet; It is the wallet that transfers the EXFW wallet to the block to generate 2.500.000.000.000 EXF. System wallet is EXF's wallet. This value, which is produced for all infrastructure operations required for EXF activities, is used. </p>
                    <p>Due to the verification nature of the blockchain, all transactions are traceable. In other words, which wallet has historically done what transaction is recorded in the block. Therefore, all transactions made by all wallets; can be tracked. However, this is not a situation that a commercial enterprise can accept. Therefore, the issue of commercial privacy inherent in commerce is not supported by the underlying structure of blockchain. Within the EXF blockchain, wallets that want to avoid such traceability for purposes such as hiding their trade secrets can create untraceable sub-wallets within the EXFW wallet, thereby preventing the traceability of their transactions.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="gold-wallet-eauw">Gold Wallet (<abbr title="Exchangeable AU Wallet">EAUW</abbr>)</h3>
                    <p>The second wallet transferred to the block by the Genesis wallet; It is the wallet that it transfers to the block to generate 2.500.000.000.000 EAU. Gold wallet (EAUW) generated 2.500.000.000.000 EAU. However, all EAU transactions to be made are accompanied by the digital signature of the wallet transferred to the block by the EAUW wallet and the digital signature of the wallet transferred to the block by the Reserve wallet (RSVW).</p>
                    <p>For similar reasons as in the EXFW wallet, they can prevent the traceability of their transactions by creating untraceable sub-wallets in the EAUW wallet.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="reserve-wallet-rsvw">Reserve Wallet (<abbr title="Reserve Wallet">RSVW</abbr>)</h3>
                    <p>It is the wallet transferred to the block by the third wallet transferred to the block by the Genesis wallet. It is the wallet with the most complex function among these wallets. Wallets transferred to the block by the Reserve wallet; they just don't digitally sign EAU transactions. They also sign all asset and value transfers that can be converted to EXF and defined by the system. There are 2.500.000.000.000 EAUs in exchange for 2.500.000.000.000 EXF as a priority. EAUs are digital gold reserves, the equivalent of EXFs. And the transfer takes place with the signature of the wallets transferred by the “Reserve” wallet to the block.</p>
                    <p>EAU can be purchased with EXF. When you buy EAU, these digital golds are transferred to your EAU wallet. From this new EAU wallet, you can always transfer EAUs as EXF to your EXF wallet.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="investment-wallet-insw">Investment Wallet (<abbr title="Investment Wallet">INSW</abbr>)</h3>
                    <p>By the fourth wallet transferred to the block by the Genesis wallet; is the wallet transferred to the block. This wallet is an investment wallet. All kinds of investments are made through this wallet. The brokers of the investment wallet act as "investment advisors". Anyone (with a confidence score of 4.40 and above) can become an investment advisor in the system.</p>
                    <p>For the investment wallet, projects are submitted through an investment advisor. In this presentation, the financial flow should be in the form specified for the system. The conditions under which the investors will start the investment and under which conditions they will withdraw from the investment should be in the form determined in the system. The finance put forward by the investors is transferred to the wallet of the project owner or owners through the "Investment Advisor" intermediary. The profit obtained at the end of the project is transferred to the shareholders through the investment advisor intermediary.</p>
                    <h2 class="sub-header highlight" id="ownership-rights-of-wallets">Ownership Rights of Wallets</h2>
                    <p>Within the EXF system; main wallets, local regulators, mediators, decision makers, representatives or a wallet in any other role; cannot interfere, suspend, freeze or redirect any wallet account. Under no circumstances and conditions; personal or institutional property rights cannot be interfered with. However, there are two exceptions to this. These;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1. In the case of 150 years of inactivity for individual wallets (300 years in case of heirs), and 350 years of inactivity for corporate wallets, their assets are transferred to the local regulators and EXF wallet at the discretion of the decision makers. For wallets whose transactions are signed by the Reserve (RSVW) wallet (for example, wallets that have purchased EAU) do not trade for 1000 years; assets are transferred to local regulators and the Reserve (RSVW) wallet at the discretion of the decision makers. When the time comes, local regulators present the documents to the decision makers, enabling them to reach a decision on the necessary transfer.</li>
                        <li>2. Death of a wallet owner; The meaning of the wallet owner's death is this; is the death of the wallet owner and the wallet access information cannot be obtained by the heirs. If access information has been obtained by legal heirs, necessary transfer procedures can be made by them. However, in the absence of access information, action will be taken according to the following conditions.
                            <ol>
                                <li> a) In case of heirs and representatives; the owner of the wallet, before his death, determines the wallets that will be his heirs, the rate and amount of inheritance; digitally signed the wallet that he designated as the representative. Representative; the documents proving the death of the wallet owner and the inheritance rates and amounts digitally signed by the wallet owner to the representative; transfers to the block. And the local regulators signs the same block. And the action is taken according to the decision made by the decision makers.</li>
                                <li> b) If the representative is determined and there is no heir, the representative; transfers the death of the wallet owner to the block. Next, the representative receives the necessary payments for the transaction. And wallet funds; timeout period (specified in clause 1) is expected.</li>
                                <li> c) Absence of a representative;
                                    <ol>
                                        <li> I) In case of heir; heirs submit documents proving that they are heirs to local regulators. Local regulators present the documents to the decision makers, and action is taken in accordance with the decision made. In the absence of an heir; the expiry period of wallet funds (specified in clause 1) is expected.</li>
                                        <li> II) In the absence of an heir; wallet funds are expected to expire (specified in clause 1).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>d) If the representative is designated by the wallet and the representative is dead, the representative is considered undetermined. Documents regarding the death of the representative are prepared by the legal heirs and submitted to the local regulators. And it is prepared by local regulators and transferred into the block with the decision of the decision makers.</li>
                                <li>e) If the heir is determined by the wallet and the heir is dead, the heir is considered undetermined. If more than one heir is determined and one or more of the heirs have died, the inheritance is distributed to the remaining heirs in accordance with the rate determined by the decision makers with the presentation of the local regulators.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The personal or corporate property rights of the wallets are not interfered with. However, unfair action was taken; for wallets that are definitively identified by decision makers; At the end of the objection period, the decision is transferred to the block. And the necessary trust score adjustment is made in line with the decision made by the decision makers. Even this transaction cannot create any interference on the ownership right of the wallet. Or, it cannot create any restrictions and freezes on EXF and asset transfers. Except for the restrictions caused by the lowering of the trust score, of course.</p>                    
                    <p>The EXF system has a principle-based paradigm. It's not rule based. What is explained throughout the entire document is merely an elaboration of the principles. The most basic principle is equality of equals. This principle; means that those who are on equal terms are equal. That is, for example, all wallets with 5 trust score will have the same authorization and rights. However, this is not always the case. This is because it is principle-based, not rule-based. It may be thought that there is a contradictory discourse here, but it is not so, let's explain. For example; Let's consider the same example scenario being the subject of dispute between wallets located in different countries (political regions). The result of this dispute; may not be concluded in the same way by decision makers. This is the correct one. The same scenario may lead decision makers to take a different decision as a result of different laws applied in different countries. If EXF were rule-based, it would accept the same result as a paradigm. However, this is not the correct one. The same conditions can produce different results in different countries. This is the nature of life. Considering these different results and the laws of that country, it will lead to different results for equal scenarios, and this is the truth. This is not an inequality, but the equality of equals, which we have explained as the basic principle. For example, the same applies to the subject of inheritance. The principle here is; decision makers must decide for the dispute in accordance with the laws of that country. Maybe the laws for that country may change, but the principle will remain the same for EXF.</p>
