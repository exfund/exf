                    <p>At the end of all transactions between wallets, wallets can review each other.  Even if the transactions between the wallets are canceled or the transaction is never started between the wallets (even if there is no transaction between them), the wallets may review each other. The determinant here is that the wallets have established contacts within the EXF system. However, in order for such an evaluation (no transaction between them or the transaction to be cancelled) to be made, the wallet that wants to evaluate must take the necessary decision from the decision makers (to make an evaluation) with justified reasons.</p>
                    <p>The most basic criterion for proof in transactions is that the person performing the transaction is obliged to prove it. Just like two people shopping online, the buyer has to prove that she sent the money and the seller has to prove that she has delivered the goods. The buyer cannot prove that she did not receive the goods, and this is not expected from her. The seller is obliged to prove that she has delivered the goods. However, the buyer has to prove (claiming) that the goods she received is defective, dysfunctional or not as described before the sale. In short, the perpetrator is obliged to prove that she has done it.</p>
                    <p>Review is a confidence-building action because it is for the benefit of the community, while not reviewing is a confidence-destroying action. Taking or not doing this action has a counterpart in the trust protocol. All reviews, positive or negative, made by a wallet are actions for the benefit of the community. An review; regardless of whether it is positive or negative, when it is transferred in the block, the trust score will increase for the wallet that made that review, due to the review. Once an review is imported into the block, it can no longer be changed.</p>
                    <p>For wallets transacting between them; if the wallet, which is the party of the transaction, has taken the expected steps in the required manner and at the prescribed time; 5 stars are expected to be given to that wallet. In this case, an explanation, photo, video, etc. can be added as to why it was given 5 stars. However, when less than 5 stars are given, concrete reasons for why it was given are expected. In the event of a low score, the wallet receiving that score can create a dispute or offer a mediator. </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="1-star">1 Star</h3>
                    <p>When a star is awarded, the trust score of the wallet awarded a star will be reduced by 5 points (-5). A star that you have given means that the wallet is absolutely unreliable and should not be worked with that wallet. When you give a star, you are expected to add the supporting elements from the attachments section. In addition, the score to be calculated based on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will be deducted. </p>
                    <p>If the wallet that received this score files a dispute and shows that this rating is unjustified. In this case, the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will be reduced by 15 points (-15). In addition, the score to be calculated depending on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will also be deducted. 1 star given will also be cancelled. However, if it turns out that the wallet that issued the score was right about the score it was awarded. For 1 time regarding this dispute to the wallet that gave the score; an additional 15 points will be awarded, as well as a score to be calculated based on the current confidence score.</p>
                    <p>When this scoring is transferred into the block without any dispute. 5 trust points will be transferred to the wallet that gave this score. And the score that will be calculated based on the current trust score of the rated wallet will also be transferred.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="2-star">2 Star</h3>
                    <p>When two stars are awarded, the trust score will be reduced by 3 points (-3). The two star that you have given means that the wallet is unreliable and should not be worked with that wallet. When you give two stars, you are expected to add the elements that support this in the appendices section. In addition, the score to be calculated based on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will be deducted. </p>
                    <p>If the wallet that received this score files a dispute and shows that this rating is not justified, then the trust score of the wallet that issued the rating will be reduced by 14 points (-14). In addition, the score to be calculated depending on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will also be deducted. The 2 stars given will also be cancelled. However, if the wallet that issued the score is found to be right about the score, the wallet that issued the score will be awarded 14 points, once related to this dispute, plus an additional score to be calculated based on the current trust score.</p>
                    <p>When this score is transferred into the block without any dispute, 4 trust points will be transferred to the wallet that gave this score. And the score that will be calculated based on the current trust score of the wallet where the score is given will also be transferred.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="3-star">3 Star</h3>
                    <p>When three stars are given, no points will be added to the confidence index. The three stars you have given mean that there is no positive opinion about the trust of the wallet that is being traded.  When you give three stars, you are expected to add the elements that support this in the appendices section.</p>
                    <p>If the wallet that received this score files a dispute and shows that this rating is not justified, then the trust score of the wallet that issued the rating will be reduced by 13 points (-13). In addition, the score to be calculated depending on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will also be deducted. The 3 stars given will also be cancelled. However, if it turns out that the wallet giving the score was right about the score it gave; The wallet that gave the score will be given 13 points, once related to this dispute. And also, the score to be calculated based on the current confidence score will be given additionally.</p>
                    <p>When this score is transferred into the block without any dispute, 3 trust points will be given to the wallet that gave this score. And the score that will be calculated based on the current trust score of the rated wallet will also be transferred.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="4-star">4 Star</h3>
                    <p>When four stars are awarded, 3 points will be added to the confidence index. The four stars you give indicate that the wallet is reliable. And it means that it can be worked with. When four stars are given, the supporting elements can be added from the appendices section. In addition, the score to be calculated based on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will be added.</p>
                    <p>If the wallet that received this score files a dispute and shows that your scoring was intentional, then the trust index of the wallet that issued the score will be reduced by 10 points (-10). In addition, the score to be calculated based on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will be deducted. The 4 stars it has given will also be cancelled. However, if the wallet that issued the score is found to be right about the score awarded, the wallet that issued the score will be awarded 11 points, once for this dispute. And also, the score to be calculated based on the current confidence score will be given additionally.</p>
                    <p>When this score is transferred into the block without any dispute, 2 trust points will be transferred to the wallet that gave this score.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="5-star">5 Star</h3>
                    <p>When five stars are given, 5 points will be added to the confidence index. The five stars you have given indicate that the wallet is very reliable and it is recommended to work with it. When five stars are given, the supporting elements can also be added in the appendices section. In addition, the score to be calculated based on the trust score of the wallet that gave the score will be added.</p>
                    <p>When this score is transferred into the block, 1 trust point will be transferred to the wallet that gave this score.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="comment">Comment</h3>
                    <p>They are explanations about the content of the transaction and how the other party performed the transaction. These are the notes that other wallets who want to trade with the same person should know.</p>
                    <p>Expressions other than profanity, insults or general moral rules should never be used in explanations. The trust points of the detected wallets will be reduced according to the decision of the decision makers according to the nature of the action. </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="sharing">Sharing</h3>
                    <p>From the wallet where the transaction is made; It is the sharing made as a result of being satisfied with the result of the transaction or vice versa (after the evaluations are transferred to the block). In accordance with this sharing trust protocol (if the wallet to share has sufficient trust points); It is the share made to the wallets that follow the wallet that will share.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header highlight" id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3>
                    <p>The stronger advice (advice to work or not to work) than sharing is; It is the sharing made as a result of being satisfied with the transaction, or vice versa (after the evaluations are transferred to the block). In accordance with the trust protocol (if the wallet to recommend has sufficient trust points), it is a share to other wallets that it has traded before.</p>

                    <p>Wallets are expected to consider the following basic criteria when reviewing each other in their transactions.</p>
